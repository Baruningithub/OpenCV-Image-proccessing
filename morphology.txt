Erosion: 
A pixel in the original image (either 1 or 0) will be considered 1 only if all the pixels 
under the kernel is 1, otherwise it is eroded (made to zero).So what happends is that, all the 
pixels near boundary will be discarded depending upon the size of kernel

Dilation: 
It is just opposite of erosion. Here, a pixel element is '1' if at least one pixel under the kernel 
is '1'. So it increases the white region in the image or size of foreground object increases.

Opening: 
erosion followed by dilation

Closing: 
Dilation followed by Erosion

Morphological Gradient: 
It is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image.

Top Hat: 
It is the difference between input image and Opening of the image.

Black Hat: 
It is the difference between the closing of the input image and input image.
